		<p>Raceway Woods is a forest preserve in Carpentersville, IL located at the corner of Huntley Road and Route 31. Trails here are under development in a partnership between CAMBr North and the Forest Preserve District of Kane County. There is currently approximately one mile of trail that is built and ready to ride! Best place to start is the silo parking lot off of Illinois Route 31 just north of the intersection with Huntley Road.</p>

		<p>These trails are built by volunteers who love their sport. Would you consider <a href="/donate">donating a dollar to build a foot of trail</a>?</p>
